# Minneapolis Crime 
### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrisdal/minneapolis-incidents-crime is the link to the original dataset. The crimes.csv dataset was used as the original dataset for the project 
### The crimes.csv dataset was cleaned in order to eliminate columns that were not needed and to eliminate missing data
### The times were also turned into numerical hours and the hours were also binned in a separate column. The bins were split into 2 hour intervals. This was eventually dropped and redone on Cleaned_data 
### The years were also seperated and each year was filitered into a violent and non violent crime section. 

## The analysis for this project is still being worked on and will be posted once it's completed
